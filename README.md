# Forecasting-COVID-19

This app was built as part of the UCLA Extension Data Science Hackathon.
This app uses Linear Regression, Random Forests, XGboost, and Facebook Prophet to generate the forecasts for the next 14 days.

The data used for training the models was obtained from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University
